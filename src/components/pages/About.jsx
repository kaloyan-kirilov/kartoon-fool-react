                    &nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Kaloyan Kirilov and I'm an artist from Bulgaria. I've been especially interested in cartoons and animation ever since I could remember. The moving and talking drawings on TV were so captivating to me as a kid that I would try and draw my favorite cartoon characters as to keep myself entertained for whenever the shows were over. At some point in time I realized that I didn't actually grow out of it and it wasn't childish fun for me anymore, but an actual art form that I find very appealing. Steadily my curiosity increased for the process and people behind this medium and it was no longer just funny pictures. It was about various skills, talents and ultimately a combined dedication to an artistic expression. A funny business that I take quite seriously, but also one that is seriously fun.
