                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Kaloyan Kirilov, and I'm an artist from Bulgaria. I've been especially interested in cartoons and animation ever since I could hardly remember. The moving and talking drawings on TV were so captivating to me as a kid that I would try and draw my favorite cartoon characters to keep myself entertained whenever the shows were over. This habit continued for a while, and at some point in time I realized that I hadn't actually grown out of it. What began as childish fun turned into an actual art form that I found myself enjoying even into adulthood. Steadily, my curiosity about the process and people behind this medium increased. They were no longer just funny pictures on a screen. It was a representation of various skills, talents and ultimately a combined dedication to an artistic expression. A funny business that I take quite seriously, but also one that is seriously fun!
